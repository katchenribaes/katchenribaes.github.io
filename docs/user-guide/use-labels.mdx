Labeling is used to identify raw data, such as images, videos, etc, and provide context so that a machine learning model learns from it. For example, labels may be used to indicate if a video contains cars, or if an ultrasound shows a tumor.

Labeling is used for training advanced algorithms to recognize patterns in the future.

In this section, you will learn how to:
- [Prepare your data for labeling](#prepare-your-data-for-labeling).
- [Read labels](#read-labels).
- [Save labels](#save-labels).

## Prepare your data for labeling 

> Placeholder for how to prepare data for labeling.

## Read labels

To successfully read labels, take the following steps:

1. Authenticate using your private key. If you haven't set up your private key yet, follow the instructions in the [Authenticate](/docs/user-guide/authenticate) page.
1. Access annotations by adding the `Project` class, as follows:
    ```
    from encord.project import Project

    def get_project(self, project_hash: str) -> Project:
            """
            Get the Project class to access project fields and manipulate a project.

            You will only have access to this project if you are one of the following

                * Project admin

                * Project team manager

                * Organisation admin of the project

            Args:
                project_hash: The Project ID
            """
            config = SshConfig(self.user_config, resource_type=TYPE_PROJECT, resource_id=project_hash)
            querier = Querier(config)
            client = EncordClientProject(querier=querier, config=config)
            return Project(client)
    ```
1. Get all the label details by adding the `EncordClientProject.get_label_row` class, as follows: 
    ```
    from typing import Iterable, List, Optional, Set, Tuple, Union
    from encord.orm.label_row import (
        
        AnnotationTaskStatus,
        LabelRow,
        LabelRowMetadata,
        LabelStatus,
        Review,
        ShadowDataState,
    )

    def get_label_row(
        self,
        uid: str,
        get_signed_url: bool = True,
        *,
        include_object_feature_hashes: Optional[Set[str]] = None,
        include_classification_feature_hashes: Optional[Set[str]] = None,
        include_reviews: bool = False,
    ) -> LabelRow:
        """
        Retrieve label row. If you need to retrieved multiple label rows, prefer using
        :meth:`encord.project.Project.get_label_rows` instead.

        A code example using the `include_object_feature_hashes` and `include_classification_feature_hashes`
        filters can be found in :meth:`encord.project.Project.get_label_row`.

        Args:
            uid: A label_hash   (uid) string.
            get_signed_url: Whether to generate signed urls to the data asset. Generating these should be disabled
                if the signed urls are not used to speed up the request.
            include_object_feature_hashes: If None all the objects will be included. Otherwise, only objects labels
                will be included of which the feature_hash has been added.
            include_classification_feature_hashes: If None all the classifications will be included. Otherwise, only
                classification labels will be included of which the feature_hash has been added.
            include_reviews: Whether to request read only information about the reviews of the label row.

        Returns:
            LabelRow: A label row instance.

            Raises:
            AuthenticationError: If the project API key is invalid.
            AuthorisationError: If access to the specified resource is restricted.
            ResourceNotFoundError: If no label exists by the specified label_hash (uid).
            UnknownError: If an error occurs while retrieving the label.
            OperationNotAllowed: If the read operation is not allowed by the API key.
        """
        return self._client.get_label_row(
            uid,
            get_signed_url,
