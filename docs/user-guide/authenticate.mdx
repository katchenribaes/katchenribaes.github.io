Authentication is the process you use to confirm your identity through credentials, thus proving that you are who you say you are.

In SSH, public key cryptography is used for authenticating computers and users. Public key authentication gives you full access to all the capabilities of the SDK.

The public key encryption works with two separate keys (i.e. asymmetric authentication). These two keys form a pair that is specific to each user, as follows:

- A public key: Anyone with a copy of the public key can encrypt data which can then only be read by the person who holds the corresponding private key. Once an SSH server receives a public key from a user and considers the key trustworthy, the server marks the key as authorized.

- A private key that remains (only) with the user: The possession of this key is proof of the user's identity. Only a user in possession of a private key that corresponds to the public key will be able to authenticate successfully.

## Set up public key authentication

A public-private key pair is required for authentication. Register the public key with Encord and use your private key as your credentials.

### Requirements

- **Linux/MacOS**: use the default terminal
- **Windows 10 & Server 2019/2022**: use Powershell

## Generate a public-private key pair

Take the following steps to set up public key authentication (for SSH):

1. Open a terminal.
1. Run the following command:
    ```
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 
    ```
1. Type the file location where both private and public keys will be stored, as follows:
    - For **Mac** users:
    ```
    > Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM): /Users/YOU/.ssh/id_encord
    ```
    - For **Windows** users:
    ```
    > Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM): C:\Users\YOU/.ssh/id_encord
    ```
    - For **Linux** users:
    ```
    > Enter file in which to save the key (/home/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM): /home/YOU/.ssh/id_encord
    ```

1. In the following prompts, press enter (do **NOT** type any passphrase):
    ```
    > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press ENTER]
    > Enter same passphrase again: [Press ENTER]
    ```
1. The following files are generated:
    - `/path/to/your/key/id_encord` contains your private key (which you should handle carefully).
    - `/path/to/your/key/id_encord.pub` contains your public key (usually in a file ending in _.pub_).

## Add the public key to Encord 

Now that you set up your public-private key pair, you must add the public key to Encord's webapp.

1. In the terminal, run the following command:
    ```
    $ cat /path/to/your/key/id_encord.pub
    ```
1. Select and copy the content of `id_encord.pub` file displayed in the terminal.
1. In Encord's UI, open the **User** icon and select **Settings**. 
1. Select **Public keys** and **+ New key**.
1. Choose a name for your public key and paste the previously copied content. 
    :::tip
    The key should have the following format: `ssh-ed25519 <several characters>`.
    :::
1. Select **Create** to register your key.

You are now ready to authenticate with your private key.

## Authenticate with private key

:::info
Note that, in this step, you should have already installed Encord's SDK. If you haven't taken this step yet, learn how to [install](/docs/user-guide/install-encord-sdk) Encord's SDK.
:::

To authenticate with Encord, add the following snippet to your Python script:

```
from pathlib import Path
from encord.user_client import EncordUserClient

# adapt the following line to your private key path
private_key_path = Path.home() / ".ssh" / "id_encord"

with private_key_path.open() as f:
    private_key = f.read()

user_client = EncordUserClient.create_with_ssh_private_key(private_key)
```
