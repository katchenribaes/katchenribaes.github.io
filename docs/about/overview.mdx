This documentation provides detailed information about the endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms for interacting with the API.



## Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is:

```
https://api.onlineshop.com
```


## Authentication

API authentication is a crucial aspect of securing access to your API endpoints. This section outlines the authentication method implemented in our API, providing instructions on how to authenticate requests and obtain access to protected resources.

### Authentication Flow

1. The client sends a POST request to the `/authenticate` endpoint with valid credentials (e.g., username and password).
1. The API server verifies the credentials and generates a Json Web Token (JWT) containing the user's identity and other relevant data.
1. The server responds with a JSON object containing the generated JWT.
1. The client stores the JWT securely for subsequent API requests.
1. For each subsequent request, the client includes the JWT in the Authorization header as "Bearer {JWT}", as follows:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer {JWT}
    ```

    For example, if your JWT is `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9`, the Authorization header should be:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
    ```

JWT authentication provides a secure and reliable method to authenticate API requests. By following the provided authentication flow and including the JWT in subsequent requests, clients can securely access protected endpoints.

## Request and response formats

The API accepts and returns data in JSON format.

## Error handling

When an error occurs, the API returns an appropriate HTTP status code along with a JSON response body containing the error details.

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 404,
    "message": "Not found - the good you're looking for does not exist in the system."
  }
}
```
